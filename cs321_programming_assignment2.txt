Due Monday November 4, 10pm

You may work in groups of up to three on this assignment.

Implement a binary emulator for the LEGv8 ISA.  Your emulator will take as
input an assembled LEGv8 program (assembler is posted with this document) and
execute it.  After the program completes, it will display a number of
statistics about the program's execution, namely:

* The number of cycles required to execute the program on an unpipelined
  implementation of the ISA
* The number of cycles required to execute the program on a 5-stage-pipelined
  implementation of the ISA (the 5 stages in the textbook and that we are
  discussing in lecture) without bypassing or branch prediction.
* The number of data hazards incurred by the program in the 5-stage pipeline
* The number of control hazards incurred by the program in the 5-stage
  pipeline
* The number of cycles required to execute the program on a 5-stage-pipelined
  implementation of the ISA with bypassing but no branch prediction.

Your emulator should implement the following instructions (with notes):

* ADD
* ADDI
* AND
* ANDI
* B
* B.cond: This is a CB instruction in which the Rt field is not a register,
          but a code that indicates the condition extension.  These have the
          values (base 16):
            * 0: EQ
            * 1: NE
            * 2: HS
            * 3: LO
            * 4: MI
            * 5: PL
            * 6: VS
            * 7: VC
            * 8: HI
            * 9: LS
            * a: GE
            * b: LT
            * c: GT
            * d: LE
          There is a single bit condition register associated with each of
          these codes.  The branch is taken if and only if the corresponding
          condition bit is set.  Bits are set and reset by SUBS and SUBIS.
* BL
* BR: This is an R instruction.  Only the opcode and Rt fields are used.  The
      remaining bits are don't-care.
* CBNZ
* CBZ 
* DUMP: This is an added instruction that will display the contents of all
        registers and memory, as well as the disassembled program (branch
        targets are given as the PC-relative offset from the branch
        instruction).  More details below.  This is an R instruction.  The
        opcode is 11111111110.  All other bits are don't-care. 
* EOR 
* EORI
* HALT: This is an added instruction that will trigger a DUMP and terminate
        the emulator.  This is an R instruction.  The opcode is 11111111111.
        All other bits are don't-care.
* LDUR
* LDURB
* LDURH
* LDURSW
* LSL
* LSR
* MUL
* ORR
* ORRI
* PRNL: This is an added instruction that will print a blank line.  This is
        an R instruction.  The opcode is 11111111100.  All other bits are
        don't care. 
* PRNT: This is an added instruction that prints a register name and its
        contents in hex and decimal.  This is an R instruction.  The opcode
        is 1111111101.  The register is given in the Rd field.  All other
        bits are don't-care.
* SDIV
* SMULH
* STUR 
* STURB
* STURH
* STURW
* SUB
* SUBI
* SUBIS: This instruction--and SUBS--sets condition bits after subtracting.
         The results of the subtraction, S, gives the following values for
         the condition bits:
           * EQ = S == 0
           * GE = S >= 0
           * GT = S > 0
           * HI = S > 0
           * HS = S >= 0
           * LE = S <= 0
           * LO = S < 0
           * LS = S <= 0
           * LT = S < 0
           * MI = S < 0
           * NE = S != 0
           * PL = S >= 0
           * VC = 0
           * VS = 0
* SUBS
* UDIV 
* UMULH

With respect to the DUMP instruction, your output should be similar to the
output of the dump instruction in the symbolic emulator from programming
assignment 1.  To aid you in writing the memory dumps, the hexdump function
from the symbolic emulator is given at the bottom of this document.  In
addition to explicit dumps (i.e., executing the DUMP instruction) and halts,
your emulator should also dump and terminate if the program attempts to
access an out-of-bounds address.

Your program should use separate stack and main memory regions (arrays).
This prevents the user from smashing the stack inadvertently (or on purpose),
and makes it easy for you to bounds-check the regions.  Your SP and FP
registers should be initialized to the size of the stack.  All other
registers and memory should be initialized to all-bytes-zero.

The provided assembler is also a symbolic emulator (however, it does not
print the extra data required for this assignment).  You can use it to test
the behavior of your program before attempting to run it on your binary
emulator.  It requires the -a switch to assemble a program; otherwise, the
symbolic emulator will run.  The assembled program will have the same name as
the input with ".machine" appended.
